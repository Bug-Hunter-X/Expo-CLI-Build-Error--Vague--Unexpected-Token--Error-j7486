# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague "Unexpected Token" Error

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using Expo CLI to build a React Native application. The error was vague and challenging to track down.  The problem only surfaced after installing or updating a specific library, leading to an "Unexpected Token" error during the Metro bundler stage. This issue highlights the challenges of debugging such vague error messages.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo start` or build the app using `expo build`. 

**Solution:** The solution (included in `bugSolution.js`) addresses the issue by carefully reviewing dependencies and resolving inconsistencies or conflicts between them.  It involves making minor tweaks to the code which might resolve dependency conflicts that are difficult to identify directly. This often involves checking package.json, package-lock.json, or yarn.lock and checking the versions of different libraries.  See `bugSolution.js` for a detailed description of the specific fix implemented.
