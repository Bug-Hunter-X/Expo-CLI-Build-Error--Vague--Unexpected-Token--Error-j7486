The root cause of the error was identified as a conflict between two libraries, 'react-native-svg' and 'react-native-reanimated'. Although both were valid packages individually, they were clashing in the Expo environment due to version mismatches. This conflict was difficult to detect because it didn't lead to obvious syntax errors or compiler warnings. The solution involved carefully examining the versions of these libraries within `package.json`.  In `bugSolution.js`, these versions have been updated and matched to resolve the incompatibility. In general, carefully reviewing and matching the versions of all used libraries can solve many unexplainable errors that result in vague error messages like the one reported here.
