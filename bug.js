While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, stating something like "Unexpected token" or a similar generic error without a specific file or line number.  The code itself seemed syntactically correct in my editor and other linters didn't report any issues. The error only appeared after installing or updating a specific library, causing problems during the Metro bundler phase.  This inconsistency made debugging particularly difficult.
